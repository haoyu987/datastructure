// Here's how the 1st algorithm goes.
// Consider l1 as a node on the 1st list and l2 as the corresponding node on 2nd list.
// Step 1:
// Build the 2nd list by creating a new node for each node in 1st list. 
// While doing so, insert each new node after it's corresponding node in the 1st list.
// Step 2:
// The new head is the 2nd node as that was the first inserted node.
// Step 3:
// Fix the random pointers in the 2nd list: (Remember that l1->next is actually l2)
// l2->random will be the node in 2nd list that corresponds l1->random, 
// which is next node of l1->random.
// Step 4:
// Separate the combined list into 2: Splice out nodes that are part of second list. 
// Return the new head that we saved in step 2.
